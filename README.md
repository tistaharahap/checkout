# Checkout

This app is best understood as an inheritance mechanism built for cryptocurrencies. You check in for a set period of time (every 1 month?) to use the app. When it's time you aren't available to check in anymore, the app will check out all of its cryptocurrency balance to your chosen addresses. You can also include a `Last Will Testament` letter for the transaction to be included and immortalized within the blockchain of the cryptocurrencies.
